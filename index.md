**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is computer vision and the techniques used by computers to process and analyze visual information. Specifically, it was fascinating to learn about autoencoders and vision transformers and their promising application in developing anomaly detection models. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project?**
For my Quarter 2 Project, I'd like to improve our current Vision-Transformer-based anomaly detection model and explore ways to scale it for deployment across a large network of camera systems. Currently, our model is developed and trained using data from a single camera. I would like to build upon this and see if it would be possible to expand its application across the broader ALERTCalifornia system. It would also be interesting to explore whether unsupervised learning techniques could potentially improve our model. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A valuable aspect of the ALERTCaliforia system is its extensive collection of multi-modal data, including LiDAR, infrared, multi-angular imagery, and more. Incorporating this data into our quality-of-service anomaly detection model could potentially enhance its reliability and accuracy. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Our model currently uses a Vision Transformer with an SVM classification head. It is a supervised learning technique that required manual labeling of normal vs. abnormal camera frames. I think it would be interesting to also explore an unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning method to see whether our anomaly detection model could perform better. This would be interesting as we've come to notice that there are human inconsistencies and errors within our manually labeled data.
